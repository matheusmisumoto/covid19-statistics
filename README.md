This project shows updated statistics about the Coronavirus pandemic around the world. It shows today's and total cases, and today's and total deaths worldwide, as well as from Brazil, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, United States and Portugal.

Progressive web application developed using React, with data collected from a [public API](https://disease.sh/docs/) using information from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).

Originally created using Create React App, and later migrated to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Run the app in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Build the app for production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
# or
bun build
```

Builds the app for production to the `out` folder.
It correctly bundles Next.js in production mode, as a client application, and optimizes the build for the best performance.

It uses the root path of the domain as default, but you can set a path prefix for the application defining `APP_BASE_PATH` inside a `.env` file.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
